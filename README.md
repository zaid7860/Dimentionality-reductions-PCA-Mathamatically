# Dimentionality-reductions-PCA-Mathamatically
Mathematically Using PCA technique for MNIST dataset 

# Steps

1. Colomn standarization of the given matrix , This take it's Mean to the origin with mean at [0,0,0...] 
2. Definig co-varance matrix (Square Matrix ) S(dxd)= Xt.X
3. Eigen Values and Eigen vectors of S
such that 
位1>=位2>=位3......>位d
corresponding Eigen vector 
v1,v2,v3,....vd

4. u=v1
# xi' = [xi.t v1 , xi.t v2]
